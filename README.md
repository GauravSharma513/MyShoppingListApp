# Shopping List App - A Jetpack Compose Project

This project is a foundational example of a shopping list application built using the modern Android toolkit, Jetpack Compose. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of Compose development, including state management, UI design, and user interaction.

## Core Functionalities:

- **Dynamic Item Management:** Users can seamlessly add, edit, and delete shopping items. The app utilizes a dynamic list to display items, ensuring efficient rendering even with large lists.
- **Add Item Dialog:** A user-friendly dialog facilitates the addition of new items. It includes input fields for the item name and quantity, ensuring structured data entry.
- **Item Editing:** Existing items can be modified directly within the list. Clicking on an item transitions it into an editing mode, allowing for changes to its name and quantity.
- **Item Deletion:** Items can be removed from the list with a simple action, providing a streamlined way to manage the shopping list.

## Technical Implementation:

- **Jetpack Compose:** The entire user interface is constructed using Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI toolkit that simplifies UI development and enhances app performance.
- **State Management:** Compose's state management capabilities are utilized to manage the list of shopping items and control UI elements like the "Add Item" dialog.
- **Material Design 3:** The app adheres to Material Design 3 guidelines, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user experience.
- **Kotlin:** The project is written in Kotlin, a modern programming language that enhances code readability and conciseness.
